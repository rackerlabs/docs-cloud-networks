Network concepts
================

A network is an isolated virtual layer-2 broadcast domain that is typically reserved for 
the tenant who created it, unless the network is configured to be shared. Tenants can 
create up to 10 networks per region.

In the Networks API v2.0, the network is the main entity. Ports and subnets are always 
associated with a network.

The following table describes the attributes for network objects. In the "CRUD" column, 
the abbreviations are defined as follows:

-  **C**: The attribute is used in create operations.

-  **R**: The attribute is returned in response to show and list
   operations.

-  **U**: You can update the value of this attribute.

-  **D**: You can delete the value of this attribute.
