Subnet concepts
===============

A subnet represents an IP address block that can be used to assign IP addresses to virtual 
instances. Each subnet must have a CIDR and must be associated with a network. IP addresses 
can be selected either from the whole subnet CIDR or from allocation pools that can be 
specified by the user.

A subnet can also optionally have a gateway, a list of DNS name servers, and host routes. 
This information is pushed to the cloud servers whose ports are associated with the subnet, 
as long as the ports or servers were created after the subnet was created.

The following table describes the attributes for subnet objects. In the "CRUD" column, the 
abbreviations are defined as follows:

-  **C**: The attribute is used in create operations.

-  **R**: The attribute is returned in response to show and list
   operations.

-  **U**: You can update the value of this attribute.

-  **D**: You can delete the value of this attribute.
