How the nova client works
=========================

The nova client is an open-source Python client that lets you run
commands to make Nova-Network API calls. The client is easy to learn and
use. Each client command runs cURL commands that embed API requests. You
can run the client from a desktop computer or remote system, such as a
cloud server.

You can use the nova client to perform the following operations:

#. Boot a server with isolated networks and ports.

#. Attach and detach networks from servers (if the Cloud Networks
   extension is installed).

To install the nova client on a Linux distribution or on Mac OS X, see
:ref:`Install the ova client with the Cloud Networks extension <install-nova>`.
