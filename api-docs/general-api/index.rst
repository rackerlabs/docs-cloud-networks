General API Information
=======================

The Cloud Networks API v2 is defined as a RESTful HTTP service that uses all aspects of the 
HTTP protocol, including methods, URIs, media types, and response codes. To request next 
generation Cloud Networks services, you must first issue an authentication request to the 
Rackspace Cloud Identity Service. This section provides more information about authentication, 
cURL, and filtering and pagination of requests. 

The API v2 supports JSON request and response formats.
