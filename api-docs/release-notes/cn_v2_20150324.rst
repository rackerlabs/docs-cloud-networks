API |contract version| updates, March 24, 2015
===============================================

What's new
----------

The Cloud Networks API |contract version| now includes operations for security groups
and security group rules. These operations, described in detail in the Cloud Networks 
API Developer Guide (see :ref:`Security groups operations <api-operations-sec-groups>` ), 
allow you to create, read, update, and delete security groups and security group rules. You 
can add rules to the security groups, and, using the port API operations, assign the groups 
to servers to manage the ingress (inbound) traffic for a port on a server.
