What's new
----------

The Cloud Networks Getting Started Guide now includes installation instructions and 
usage examples for the neutron client. The neutron client provides a simple, command-line 
interface to the Cloud Networks API, similar to the nova client for Cloud Servers and the 
trove client for Cloud Databases. All these clients are actually executing cURL operations 
in the background.
