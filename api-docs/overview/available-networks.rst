=============================
Which networks are available?
=============================

The Rackspace Public Cloud enables you to attach one or more of the following networks to 
your server:

.. _cn-dg-overview-available-public:

Public (PublicNet)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rackspace PublicNet connects the cloud infrastructure components (like servers, load 
balancers, and network appliances) to the Internet. PublicNet is optimized for north-south 
traffic (traffic flowing to and from the Internet). It follows a direct addressing model, 
so that all public IP addresses are directly configured on the servers without using 
Network Address Translation (NAT). PublicNet is dual-stacked for IPv4 and IPv6. When you 
create servers with PublicNet, your servers get an IPv4 and an IPv6 address by default.

When you list networks, PublicNet is labeled ``public``.

.. _cn-dg-overview-available-service:

Service (ServiceNet)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ServiceNet is an internal, IPv4-only multi-tenant network within each Rackspace Cloud 
region that is optimized to carry *east-west* traffic. It provides servers access to regional 
services such as Cloud Files, Cloud Load Balancers, Cloud Databases, and Cloud Backup at no 
cost. ServiceNet is also required for Windows Cloud Server activation. We recommend that 
you connect servers to ServiceNet so that they can access these services. The networks 
``10.176.0.0/12`` and ``10.208.0.0/12`` are reserved for ServiceNet.

When you list networks, ServiceNet is labeled ``private``.

.. _cn-dg-overview-available-isolated:

Isolated networks (Cloud Networks)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Isolated networks are user-defined L2 networks that are fully isolated and single-tenant, 
and offer users a means to securely connect their application servers. They are provided 
at no charge. Isolated Networks can now be provisioned either as IPv4 or IPv6, or they can 
be dual stacked (IPv4 and IPv6). Isolated networks are recommended for all inter-server 
communication. Even though ServiceNet can also be used for server east-west (backend) 
connectivity, ServiceNet is not recommended for that purpose because, unlike isolated 
networks, ServiceNet is multi-tenant. Isolated networks also include full support for 
the broadcasting and multicasting required for some clustering technologies.
