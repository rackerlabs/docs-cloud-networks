Which networks are attached during provisioning?
================================================

Which networks get attached, manually or automatically, to a newly provisioned server 
depends on which of the following methods you use to provision that server:

-  **Cloud Servers Neutron API**: You must specify the networks that you want to attach to 
   your server. The UUID for ServiceNet is ``11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`` and the 
   UUID for PublicNet is ``00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000``.

..  note::

    The Neutron API is currently accessible by using cURL commands, browser plug-ins for 
    REST, or various programming languages and tools. The neutron client is not supported 
    at this time.

-  **nova boot command**: You must specify the networks that you want to attach to your 
   server. If you do not specify any networks, ServiceNet and PublicNet are attached by 
   default. To attach to isolated networks that you have created, you must explicitly specify 
   them in the command. If you do so, those networks, in addition to PublicNet and ServiceNet, 
   are attached to your server.

-  **Cloud Control Panel**: PublicNet and ServiceNet are automatically attached, but you 
   can disable these networks during the server creation process. You can also attach any 
   isolated networks that you have created.

..  note::

    You can explicitly opt out of attaching to the Rackspace networks, which introduces 
    certain potential complications. For more information, see :ref:`Consequences of 
    detaching from Rackspace networks <cn-dg-overview-consequences>`.
