Attach your network to an existing server
-----------------------------------------

You can attach your network to existing servers by using the nova-network API. The neutron 
API does not provide an equivalent operation. See `Cloud Servers Getting Started Guide 
Virtual Interfaces <http://docs.rackspace.com/servers/api/v2/cs-gettingstarted/content/nova_summary_virtualints.html>`__
for examples of attaching a network to an existing server by using the nova-network API 
and the Cloud Networks virtual interface extension.
