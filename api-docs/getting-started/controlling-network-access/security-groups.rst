Use security groups and rules to control traffic
-------------------------------------------------

.. Important:: 

   The Security Groups API is currently in Limited Availability. It is available only to 
   Managed Infrastructure customers and not to RackConnect or Managed Operations customers. 
   To use this feature, contact Rackspace Support.

A security group is a named container for security group rules, which provide Rackspace 
Public Cloud users the ability to specify the types of traffic that are allowed to pass 
through, to, and from ports (Public/ServiceNet) on a Cloud server instance. After an 
instance is active, you can assign one or more security groups to Neutron ports on that 
instance. You cannot apply security groups to a port at boot time.


.. Note:: 

   There are no default security groups created for you in your Rackspace account. In order 
   to use security groups, you have to create them first and then apply them to Neutron 
   ports that belong to Cloud Server instances.

For more information about security groups and security group rules, see
:ref:`Security groups and rules<concepts-security-groups>`.

The following flow chart shows the steps for creating, using, and modifying security groups 
and rules. Detailed steps are provided in this section.

The sections are also organized by example type. To simplify your path through this chapter, 
decide whether you prefer neutron-client or cURL examples.

**Next step:** Choose one of the following methods:

-  `Using security groups and rules with neutron client <security-groups-with-neutron>`
-  `Using security groups and rules with cURL <security-groups-with-curl>`
