This Getting Started Guide shows how to send requests by using 
cURL and the Nova client command line tools.

To learn about other ways to use Rackspace Cloud API services, see the following resources:

- If you are developing applications or automation, try using 
  :rax-dev:`Rackspace SDKs<sdks>`, :rax-devdocs:`Rackspace CLI<rack-cli/>`, 
  or :os-wiki:`OpenStack client applications <wiki/OpenStackClients>`.

-  For API development, testing and workflow management in a graphical environment, try
   interacting with the API by using an application such as
   `Postman <http://www.getpostman.com>`__ or
   `RESTClient for Firefox <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient>`__.
